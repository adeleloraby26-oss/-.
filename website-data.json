            "Hello World! My name is ADEL ELORABY,I started my coding journey at the age of 12, initially learning game development with Unity Engine. Since then, I've evolved into a full-stack developer with a passion for backend systems.",
            "I'm mostly self-taught, with additional training from Digital Cubs of Egypt Initiative, ITI (Information Technology Institute), and NTI (National Telecommunication Institute). I love logical thinking and calculations, which is why I prefer backend development over frontend.",
            "When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing chess, reading Arabic and translated novels, and working on my language skills. My English is good, and I aspire to master German alongside my native Arabic."
